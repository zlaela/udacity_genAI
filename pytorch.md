# Pytorch

https://pytorch.org/

An open-source ML framework used for developing and training deep learning models. SUports GPU acceleration and dynamic computation graphs.

## Tensors

- `Tensor` - Generalized versions of n-dimensional vectors and matrices. They hold data for processsing with operations like addition or multiplication.
  - Matrices are a 2-dimensional form of tensors
- `Matrix Operations` - Calculations involving matrices (2d arrays)
- `Scalar Values` - Single numbers or quantities that can only have magnitude, not direction (ex: 7, or 3.14).
- `Linear Algebra` - An area of math focusted on vector spaces and oeprations that can be performed on vectors and matrices.
