# Practice problems and notes from the Udacity Generative AI nanodegree

Each course's excercises and notes is in its own branch. Excercises are in Jupyter notebooks, concepts are in markdown files. Code comments for my understanding.

- Course 1: Welcome to the Nanodegree Program! (no branch)
- Course 2: Generative AI Fundamentals (branch: genAiFundamentals)
