# Transfer Learning

Using a pre-trained model for a new, but related, task.

- A model is trained with a very large data set.
- Another user takes the pretrained model and uses a smaller dataset to further train the model, specializing it to the new data.
- The training typically takes much less time.
- The final layer of the model will change to match the requirements of the new task.
